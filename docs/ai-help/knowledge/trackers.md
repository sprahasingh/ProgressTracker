### ID: restore-deleted-tracker
**Category:** trackers
**Question:** Can I restore a deleted tracker?
**Aliases:**
- Where do deleted trackers go?
- How do I recover a tracker from the Bin?
**Keywords:** Bin, restore, deleted tracker, archive, recover
**Suggestible:** true
**Sources:**
- src/features/trackers/TrackerBinPage.tsx
- src/features/trackers/TrackerLibraryPage.tsx
- src/features/trackers/TrackerBinPage.test.tsx
**Answer:**
Trackers deleted through the tracker flow appear in The Bin, where you can choose Restore. Archiving or pausing a tracker is different: it stays in your tracker library and keeps its history.

### ID: bin-retention
**Category:** trackers
**Question:** What happens to a tracker after I delete it?
**Aliases:**
- Is a deleted tracker erased immediately?
- How long can I restore something from The Bin?
**Keywords:** delete, Bin, soft delete, restore, retention, permanent deletion
**Suggestible:** false
**Sources:**
- src/features/trackers/TrackerBinPage.tsx
- src/db/localRepository.ts
**Answer:**
Deleting a tracker moves it to The Bin, where it can be restored for 30 days with its saved progress and plan. Permanent deletion is disabled in this app build, so a tracker in The Bin is retained rather than immediately erased.

### ID: edit-tracker-history
**Category:** trackers
**Question:** Do tracker edits change historical statistics?
**Aliases:**
- What happens to old stats when I edit a tracker?
- Can changing a measure change old entries?
**Keywords:** edit, historical, measure type, schedule, statistics
**Suggestible:** true
**Sources:**
- src/domain/trackers/invariants.ts
- src/features/trackers/TrackerConfigurationEditor.tsx
- src/domain/trackers/analytics.ts
**Answer:**
Some edits can change which dates count in schedule-based statistics, because calculations use the tracker’s current schedule and active period. A saved measure’s type and historical interpretation are protected. Retiring a measure removes it from future check-ins while retaining its definition for old entries.

### ID: archive-tracker
**Category:** trackers
**Question:** What happens when I archive a tracker?
**Aliases:**
- Does archiving delete my tracker history?
- Can I restore a paused tracker?
**Keywords:** archive, pause, active, history, delete
**Suggestible:** true
**Sources:**
- src/features/trackers/TrackerLibraryPage.tsx
- src/features/trackers/TrackerBinPage.tsx
**Answer:**
Archiving or pausing a tracker stops it being active for future opportunities but keeps its recorded history. Deleting a tracker is a separate action that moves it through the app’s Bin and restore flow.

### ID: tracker-schedules
**Category:** trackers
**Question:** How do tracker schedules work?
**Aliases:**
- Which days count as scheduled?
- How do I choose tracking days?
**Keywords:** schedule, weekly, daily, weekdays, opportunity
**Suggestible:** true
**Sources:**
- src/domain/trackers/planning.ts
- src/features/trackers/TrackerSetupPage.tsx
**Answer:**
The schedule defines the regular days when a tracker has a check-in opportunity. You choose it while creating or editing a tracker. Standard Mode uses those scheduled dates for streak and consistency opportunities; Strict Mode treats every active date as an opportunity.

### ID: start-date-deadline
**Category:** trackers
**Question:** How do a tracker’s start date and deadline affect it?
**Aliases:**
- When does a tracker begin counting?
- Does a deadline stop future check-ins?
**Keywords:** start date, deadline, active period, schedule, tracker
**Suggestible:** true
**Sources:**
- src/domain/trackers/planning.ts
- src/domain/trackers/activePeriod.test.ts
- src/domain/trackers/planning.test.ts
- src/features/trackers/TrackerSetupPage.tsx
**Answer:**
The tracker’s active period is bounded by its start date and, when set, its deadline. Dates outside that period are not active tracking opportunities. A deadline therefore stops schedule-based calculations from counting later dates.

### ID: retire-measure
**Category:** trackers
**Question:** What happens when I retire a measure?
**Aliases:**
- Can I remove a measure but keep its history?
- Why is an old measure still shown in History?
**Keywords:** retire, measure, old entries, history, future check-ins
**Suggestible:** true
**Sources:**
- src/features/trackers/TrackerConfigurationEditor.tsx
- src/domain/trackers/types.ts
- src/domain/trackers/schema.test.ts
- src/features/history/HistoryPage.tsx
**Answer:**
Retiring a measure removes it from future check-ins while keeping its definition available to interpret older entries. That is why an old measure may still appear when you review historical data.

### ID: tracker-editing
**Category:** trackers
**Question:** How do I edit a tracker?
**Aliases:**
- Where can I change a tracker’s schedule?
- Can I add another measure to a tracker?
**Keywords:** edit, tracker, schedule, measures, configuration
**Suggestible:** true
**Sources:**
- src/features/trackers/TrackerLibraryPage.tsx
- src/features/trackers/TrackerConfigurationEditor.tsx
- src/features/trackers/TrackerSetupPage.tsx
- src/features/trackers/TrackerSetupPage.test.tsx
**Answer:**
Open Trackers, choose the tracker’s edit action, update its supported settings, then save. You can change configuration such as its schedule and add measures, while saved measure types and their historical meaning are protected.

### ID: tracker-created-active-date
**Category:** trackers
**Question:** Does a tracker count dates before I created it?
**Aliases:**
- Does its start date include days before the tracker existed?
- Why does a tracker created today start counting today?
**Keywords:** tracker creation date, start date, active period, workspace time zone
**Suggestible:** true
**Sources:**
- src/domain/trackers/planning.ts
- src/domain/trackers/activePeriod.test.ts
**Answer:**
No. The effective active period starts on the later of the configured start date and the tracker’s creation date in the workspace time zone. Earlier dates are outside the tracker’s active period.

### ID: archived-checkin-history
**Category:** trackers
**Question:** Can I edit check-ins after archiving a tracker?
**Aliases:**
- Is archived tracker history read-only?
- Does archiving keep old entries but stop edits?
**Keywords:** archived tracker, check-in, history, read-only, archive
**Suggestible:** true
**Sources:**
- src/features/history/HistoryPage.tsx
- src/features/trackers/TrackerLibraryPage.tsx
**Answer:**
Archiving keeps the tracker’s saved history, but its check-ins are read-only while the tracker is archived. Restore it to active status if you need to edit its check-ins again.
